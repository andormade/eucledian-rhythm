Implements Bjorklund’s algorithm in JavaScript to generate Eucledian rhythms

I came across Godfried Toussaint’s paper ["The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms"](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf) while I was looking for methods to generate procedural music.

That's how I bumped into E. Bjorklund and his algorithm for generating repetition patterns for the SNS neutron accelerator.
I liked the idea to use it for generating musical rhythms, so I created this JavaScript implementation.
