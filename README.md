# eucledian-rhythm
Implements Bjorklund’s algorithm in JavaScript to generate Eucledian rhythm patterns.

I came across Godfried Toussaint’s paper ["The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms"](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf) while I was looking for methods to generate procedural music.

That's how I learned about E. Bjorklund's algorithm for generating repetition patterns for the SNS neutron accelerator.
I liked the idea of using it for generating musical rhythm patterns, so I created this implementation, which I can now use in my JavaScript music sequencer.

This code is released under the MIT license, feel free to do whatever you want with it.
